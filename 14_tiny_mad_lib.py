"""Write a program which prompts the user for an adjective, then a noun, then a verb, and then prints a fun sentence with those words!

Mad Libs is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story! We've provided you with the beginning of a sentence (the SENTENCE_START constant) which will end in a user-inputted adjective, noun, and then verb."""
